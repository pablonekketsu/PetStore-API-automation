#CONCLUSIONES

The test Automation was created with Cypress to make tests on the Pet Store API, covering various operations such as adding, updating and searching for pets.

The code is organized in functions, which improves readability and facilitates maintenance.
Functions such as:
 addPet, editPet, and searchByStatus were used to modularize and reuse the code.

A readme.txt file was included providing information on the configuration, test execution and overview of the project.
 This facilitates collaboration and understanding of the project.

The API URLs are parameterized, allowing easy modification in case of changes in the endpoint or in the request parameters.

Cypress’s cy.request was used to perform HTTP requests, taking advantage of the tool’s capabilities to interact with the API effectively.

The tests are robust by verifying the response of the requests and comparing the information with the expected data, ensuring the integrity of the operations performed.

The typical test structure in Cypress was followed using describe and it blocks to organize the tests clearly.

The incorporation of data cleaning at the end of the tests could be considered to maintain a clean test environment. Error handling and retry configuration could improve the stability of the tests in unstable environments. In summary, the project demonstrates a solid implementation of automated tests.
